# Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. 
## What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?

My greatest challenge throughout college has been balancing the workload alongside everyday life. I have worked full-time throughout my college years in networking. During that time I've met a beautiful woman that I've started a family with! The life milestones of job changes, home purchase, and a new child have pushed me to consider dropping out of college from time to time.
	
 I feel the greatest hallmark of a bachelor degree is not the field or depth of study. The significance comes from committing to a multi-year project and seeing it through. I imagine that is why companies value the degree; it shows that a person is capable of completing something they start!
	
 I overcame these difficulties by seeking a work-life balance. Throughout these years, I've learned the power of breaking a large task into manageable chunks. Additionally, the value of consistent progress instead of cramming in one session. By balancing my work and academic deliverables, I've found that I am not only a better student or employee, but also a happier person.

# Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. 
## How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? 

Our production plant had an antiquated LAN. The plant was planning to install an new secondary data center. The issue is that the requirements required a more modern LAN; 1g to access layer, 10g backbone, higher speed fiber, etc.

We organized a project team including senior IT managers, network professionals, and consultants. I participated in this project as a network resource. My focus was to determine what our next technical milestones were and in what order to complete them. I needed to coordinate with technical and non-technical staff. Finally, I needed to determine hardware sourcing and work within a budget.

I feel that I performed well due to my ability to translate IT topics into high level information for non-IT stakeholders. Within the team, I strived to be level-headed, professional, and easy to work with. I feel I can improve by staying informed on other's needs and timelines. We often focus on our own deliverables, so it helps the team overall if we communicate other's needs. 

# What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? 
## Why this field and not another? 

I feel I am best suited for network engineering. I originally started with a programming learning path, but found that I did not enjoy the abstraction. 
Working with variables within a coding language didn't keep me very motivated. However, programming network devices and designing networks feels very impactful. I enjoy how networking directly affects end users and sites. Additionally, I enjoy the depth of networking. It does not feel like I am hitting a ceiling anytime soon, considering there are more complex tasks like network automation or data center design.

# What professional organizations would you like to join? 
## What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? 

I would like to join an organization focused on the public internet as a whole, like the Internet Society. The idea of working on the web's backbone and future policy sounds like the epitome of computer networking. The Internet Society's focus on a fair and secure internet for everyone aligns with my personal beliefs.

In the next five years I intend to pursue my next Cisco certification, the Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP). The CCNP certification encompasses all networking topics at a professional level of competency, like routing, wireless, and security. I feel this would be a rewarding challenge that I can take with me into my future positions.

# What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? 

I feel my studies have helped me achieve my current role in healthcare. As we open up new urgent cares and doctor offices, this makes healthcare available to the community. I take pride in the fact that I can assist in these projects and better the community.
I intend to help students in the future. I would like to visit IT college students and provide them insight into the professional side. I've considered being an adjunct teacher, once the kids are a little more grown!
